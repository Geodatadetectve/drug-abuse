Drug Abuse: Exploring the Nexus between substance Abuse and diverse criminal Activities
Business Overview/Problem
Insight Analytics Solutions has been approached by a Non-Governmental Organization eager to address a critical issue: the escalating criminal activities ostensibly linked to substance abuse. This organization has noted a marked escalation in crimes such as theft, assault, and vandalism, presumed to be connected to drug addiction within their jurisdiction. However, they find themselves without the requisite tools and insights to fully comprehend the dynamics and nuances of this alarming issue. The specific challenges they are encountering include:
 
•	Lack of Data Integration: The agency collects data from various sources, but there is no centralized system for data integration and analysis.

•	Ineffective Resource Allocation: Limited resources are currently allocated to address drug-related crime, but without accurate insights, resource allocated is suboptimal.

•	Inefficient Reporting: Current reporting methods are  time-consuming and not data-driven, making it challenging to identify trends and patterns.

•	Lack of Predictive capability: The agency lacks the capability to predict and prevent drug-related crimes proactively.

Rationale for the Project
To illustrate the nexus between substance abuse and criminal activities, consider the following examples:
 
•	Drug-Fueled Violence: An increase in violent crimes, such as domestic violence and aggravated assault, can be directly linked to substance abuse. A detailed analysis can reveal the substances involved and the specific demographics affected.
•	Overdose Incidents: Tracking overdose incidents can shed light on the most prevalent drugs in the community and highlight areas in need of addiction treatment and education programs.
•	Gang Involvement: Substance abuse often plays a role in gang-related activities, Analyzing connections between gang members and drug-related offenses can aid in dismantling criminal networks.
•	Drug Trafficking Hotspots: Identifying areas with high drug trafficking activities can help law enforcement agencies allocate resources for interdiction efforts.
 
Aim of the Project
•	Data Integration and validation: Establish robust data integration processes to compile and validate diverse datasets related to substance abuse and criminal activities, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
•	Descriptive Analysis: Perform descriptive data analysis to summarize key statistics and metrics related to drug-related crimes.
•	Frequencies, location trends, and drug types involved.
•	Trend Identification: Identify and document temporal trends in drug-related crimes, such as seasonal variations or long-term increases or decreases, using time-series analysis.
•	Location Analysis: Conduct location-based analysis to pinpoint geographical hotspots of drug-related criminal activities, supporting focused law enforcement efforts.

•	Data Visualization: Develop clear and intuitive data visualizations, such a charts, graphs, using  Excel to present analytical findings for easy interpretation by stakeholders.

Tech Stack
Excel will be used for this project, by utilizing its built-in features for data filtering, sorting, and pivot tables to explore trends and relationships within the data. Additionally, Excel's charting capabilities can help visualize patterns and summarize key insights from the dataset.

Project Scope
•	Data Collection: Gather data related to substance abuse and criminal activities from various sources, Organize this data into structured Excel spreadsheets for analysis.

•	Data Cleaning and Validation: Conduct thorough data cleaning procedures with Excel to address issues such as missing values, duplicate entries, and formatting inconsistencies.

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize Excel’s built-in statistical functions and tools to perform descriptive data analysis. Calculate key summary statistics, for crime frequencies, drug types, and demographics.

•	Data Visualization: Develop Excel - based data visualizations, Ensure that reports are structured for easy consumption by decision-makers.


INSIGHTS
Trend of crimes in 2022: Crime incidents saw a peak in December and then the lowest number of crime in a month was recorded in January.
Crime Types: Theft is the common crime, followed closely by burglary and assault.
Incident by Location: Most incidents occur in urban areas, with downtown and suburban areas showing relatively similar counts. Rural areas have the fewest incidents/crimes.
Gender Statistics: Males are involved in a significant majority of incidents, representing 69% of the total.
Age Group Data: The majority of incidents involve individuals in the 26-38 and 39-59 age groups.
Police Activity: Most incidents occur while the police are responding, with fewer during investigating and patrolling.
Drug Incidents: Cocaine and Marijuana-related incidents are the highest, with their counts being close.
Daily Incident Distribution: Incidents are fairly evenly distributed across the days of the week, with slight peaks on Weekends.
Police Response by Location: Urban areas have a higher police response in all categories (investigating, patrolling, responding) compared to suburban and rural areas.
Drug Type and Conviction: For most drug types, the number of incidents where individuals were not convicted exceeds those where they were convicted.
Income and Incidents: Low-income individuals are involved in the highest number of incidents, followed by middle-income and high-income individuals.

Recommendations:
Crime Prevention: Given the high incidents of theft, consider launching public awareness campaigns and community policing initiatives specifically targeting theft prevention.
Urban Area Focus: Allocate more police resources and surveillance to urban areas due to the higher number of incidents.
Youth Engagement: Develop youth engagement programs to address the high involvement of the 26-38 age group in incidents. This could include educational campaigns about the dangers of drugs and criminal activity.
Police Patrol Strategy: Re-evaluate patrolling strategies, especially since most incidents occur during responding periods.
